pkg/ is a collection of utility packages used by the Empire project without being specific to its internals.

Utility packages are kept separate from the empire core codebase to keep it as small and concise as possible. If some utilities grow larger and their APIs stabilize, they may be moved to their own repository, to facilitate re-use by other projects. However that is not the priority.

The directory pkg is named after the same directory in the Docker and camlistore projects.
